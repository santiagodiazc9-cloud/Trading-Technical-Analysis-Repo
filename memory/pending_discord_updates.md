# Pending Discord Updates

This file is a fallback log. When a routine's `notify.py` call fails (Discord webhook unreachable, network error, bot REST API rejection, etc.), the routine appends its summary here with a timestamp instead of halting. The dispatcher routine (or a manual catch-up) flushes these to Discord on its next successful run.

The legacy filename was `pending_clickup_updates.md` — kept the renamed file as the single fallback queue across all notification surfaces.
